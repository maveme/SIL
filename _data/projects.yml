- name: Markerless Motion Analysis of Football Goalkeepers During Penalty Kicks from Broadcast Videos
  period: 2024–2025
  objectives: To examine the relationship between goalkeepers’ preparatory posture, stance width after sidestepping, and timing variables with penalty save success in real games.
  outcomes: No significant predictors of saves were found, but goalkeepers adopted a wider preparatory stance than in lab settings and typically decreased stance width after sidestepping, contrasting with laboratory findings.
