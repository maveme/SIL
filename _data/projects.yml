- name: ‚öΩÔ∏è Markerless Motion Analysis of Football Goalkeepers During Penalty Kicks from Broadcast Videos
  period: 2024‚Äì2025
  objectives: To examine the relationship between goalkeepers‚Äô preparatory posture, stance width after sidestepping, and timing variables with penalty save success in real games.
  outcomes: No significant predictors of saves were found, but goalkeepers adopted a wider preparatory stance than in lab settings and typically decreased stance width after sidestepping, contrasting with laboratory findings.

- name: ‚öΩÔ∏è Transfer Learning for Semi-Supervised Football Event Classification Using Tracking Data
  period: 2024‚Äì2025
  objectives: To develop a semi-supervised transfer learning framework for accurate classification of football on-pitch events from scarce and imbalanced tracking data.
  outcomes: Improved event classification performance with increases of up to 15% in F1-score, 12% in precision, and 10% in AUC across both majority and minority classes by integrating latent-space oversampling and domain-adapted pretraining on high- and low-quality tracking datasets.

- name: ü•é Machine and deep learning models for batted ball velocity prediction in virtual environments
  period: 2023‚Äì2024
  objectives: To enhance a baseball batting virtual reality training environment by predicting batted ball velocities from bat swing data using machine learning and deep learning models.
  outcomes: Developed and integrated Bayesian ridge regression and multi-layer perceptron models that achieved comparable predictive accuracy to a physics-based heuristic baseline, validating the feasibility of AI-driven ball-bat collision modeling for improving realism and feedback in VR-based baseball training systems.
